# Retailrocket recommender system

## Overview

The objective of this project is to Understanding user behavior through implicit signals like clicks and views is crucial for building effective recommender systems in real-world e-commerce platforms. Being able to predict preferences from limited interaction data helps personalize user experience, boosting engagement and conversions. Simultaneously, detecting and removing abnormal traffic is essential to ensure the recommendations are based on genuine customer behavior and do not suffer from noise or bias—leading to better decision-making and higher ROI for businesses.

## Business Understanding

The primary objective is to accurately predict item properties associated with “addtocart” events based on a visitor’s prior “view” behavior, and cdetect and filter out abnormal user activity to improve the performance of recommender systems

## Data Analysis

The data will be sourced from the publicly available RetailRocket Recommender System Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/retailrocket/ecommerce-dataset which includes:
	events.csv – records user interactions (view, add to cart, transaction)
	item_properties_part1.csv and item_properties_part2.csv – describe time-stamped item properties
	category_tree.csv – describes the hierarchical relationships between product categories
